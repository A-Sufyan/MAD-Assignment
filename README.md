## Design 
🎨This application is built with an overall minimalist aesthetic in mind in order to reduce clutter and 
maximise focus when shopping. 
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font is used for its elegance and great readability. 
- Background color used throughout the app is a gray color ![#D7C8CA](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D7C8CA/000000?text=+) `#D7C8CA` for its simplicity 
- Text color is a darker gray ![#7A7A7A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/7A7A7A/000000?text=+) `#7A7A7A` to contrast background and improve readability. 
- Icon and other vector elements are simply colored white ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF` to bring home the overall minimal and calm vibe of the app

  #### Firebase Cloud Storage 
  - Firebase is a Google application software that enables mobile app developers to develop iOS, 
    Android and Web applications. We are using Firebase as a Cloud Storage to store our product data. Having a Cloud Storage 
    benefits the users as the mobile application would not take up a lot of storage space in their phones.
