## Description 
‚ÑπÔ∏è**WorthOrNot** is a Mobile Application that aims to improve its users' experience when grocery shopping.
This improvement will be attained by fulfilling these 3 criteria:
  1. Minimising spending costs
  2. Reducing time spent making decisions
  3. Improving quality of decisions made

## Design 
üé®This application is built with an overall minimalist aesthetic in mind in order to reduce clutter and 
maximise focus when shopping. 
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font is used for its elegance and great readability. 
- Background color used throughout the app is a gray color ![#D7C8CA](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D7C8CA/000000?text=+) `#D7C8CA` for its simplicity 
- Text color is a darker gray ![#7A7A7A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/7A7A7A/000000?text=+) `#7A7A7A` to contrast background and improve readability. 
- Icon and other vector elements are simply colored white ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF` to bring home the overall minimal and calm vibe of the app

## Features 
üí°Below are brief descriptions of the features implemented into this application,
detailed, step-by-step operation of each feature will be underlined in the [User Guide](#user-guide) section.

  #### Bottom Navigation bar
  - The application can be smoothly navigated across the 3 main pages, and homepage, with this navigation
    bar located at the bottom of the screen.

  #### Comparer
  - This feature fulfills criteria #3 and #1 under the descirption. It allows users to add in the price and amount of a product
    they find during a grocery shopping trip, and quickly compare them against each other to determine the product
    with best value, therefore saving on both time and money. The product can also be directly added from the Compare feature,
    into the Shopping List feature. 
    
    In practice, a user could come across 2 different boxes of cereal from 2 different brands, 
    Brand A and B for example. Brand A provides 500g of cereal at $4.50, whereas Brand B provides 800g for $11.90,

  #### Advice
  - This feature fulfills criteria #3 of the descirption as well, by letting a user navigate to a page where description of 
    products can be displayed to better inform a user's decision when purchasing products.

  #### Firebase Cloud Storage 
  - Firebase is a Google application software that enables mobile app developers to develop iOS, 
    Android and Web applications. We are using Firebase as a Cloud Storage to store our product data. Having a Cloud Storage 
    benefits the users as the mobile application would not take up a lot of storage space in their phones.


## User Guide

 The bottom nav bar is also available for users to navigate throughout the app.
