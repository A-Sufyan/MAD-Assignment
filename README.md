This improvement will be attained by fulfilling these 3 criteria:
  1. Minimising spending costs
  2. Reducing time spent making decisions
  3. Improving quality of decisions made

## Design 
üé®This application is built with an overall minimalist aesthetic in mind in order to reduce clutter and 
maximise focus when shopping. 
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) font is used for its elegance and great readability. 
- Background color used throughout the app is a gray color ![#D6CFCB](https://via.placeholder.com/15/D6CFCB/000000?text=+) `#D6CFCB` for its simplicity 
- Text color, and icons is a darker gray ![#503d42](https://via.placeholder.com/15/503d42/000000?text=+) `#503d42` to contrast background and improve readability.

## Features 
üí°Below are brief descriptions of the features implemented into this application,
detailed, step-by-step operation of each feature will be underlined in the [User Guide](#user-guide) section.

  #### Bottom Navigation bar

    bar located at the bottom of the screen.

  #### Comparer
  - This feature fulfills criteria #3 and #1 under the descirption. It allows users to add in the price and amount of a product
    they find during a grocery shopping trip, and quickly compare them against each other to determine the product
    with best value, therefore saving on both time and money. The product can also be directly added from the Compare feature,
    into the Shopping List feature. 
    
    In practice, a user could come across 2 different boxes of cereal from 2 different brands, 
    Brand A and B for example. Brand A provides 500g of cereal at $4.50, whereas Brand B provides 800g for $11.90,

  #### Advice
  - This feature fulfills criteria #3 of the descirption as well, by letting a user navigate to a page where description of 
    products can be displayed to better inform a user's decision when purchasing products.

  #### Shopping List
  - This feature fulfills criteria #2, by allowing a user to plan their trip to the grocery store before they even 
    leave the house. The items stored in the list are inputted completely up to the user's exact specifications, with a dynamically
    changing icon according to the type of product.

  #### Firebase 
  - Firebase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) application that acts as a backend server for the mobile application. Firebase provides Firestore Database, Realtime Database,          Authentication, Crash analytics, Google analytics, Remote Configuration, and Cloud Messaging. This is helpful to developers because it provides a quick installation of the      databases, collates all application crash analytics. This is used within the app to monitor user traffic and log crashes for patching.
